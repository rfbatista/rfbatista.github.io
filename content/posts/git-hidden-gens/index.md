This post is based on a talk with the same name from Enrico Campidoglio in Copenhagen DevFest 2023.
There is a link to the talk in references section of this post.

Git have a lot of functions that we do not use on daily basis, in this post I will bring to light some functionalities that I think could be useful for our toolbox. There are people that just want to keep using some Git GUI, that is ok, and will work on most cases, but you are limited by what another programmer put as a feature in the GUI you are using. On my point of view it pays on the long run to study and get to know more about tools like Git, that we have to deal every day.
