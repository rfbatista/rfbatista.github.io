# Install gRPC Plugin

```go
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
```
The compiler plugin protoc-gen-go will be installed in $GOBIN, defaulting to $GOPATH/bin. It must be in your $PATH for the protocol compiler protoc to find it.


Future-proofing services
https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/master/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc/README.md
By default, to register services using the methods generated by this tool, the service implementations must embed the corresponding Unimplemented<ServiceName>Server for future compatibility. This is a behavior change from the grpc code generator previously included with protoc-gen-go. To restore this behavior, set the option require_unimplemented_servers=false. E.g.:

  protoc --go-grpc_out=. --go-grpc_opt=require_unimplemented_servers=false[,other options...] \
Note that this is not recommended, and the option is only provided to restore backward compatibility with previously-generated code.
