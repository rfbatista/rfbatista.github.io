To crete adaptative systems you need to take a holistic approache, combining business strategy, software architecture and team organization

- Wardley Mapping
- Domain Driven Design (DDD)
- Team Topologies

> "a system is more than the sum of its parts. Itâ€™s a product of their interactions. The way parts fit together determines the performance of a system - not on how they perform taken separately." - Dr. Russell Ackoff

# How to design adaptative systems

1. Undersand the business landscape <- Wardley Mapping
2. Knowing the business domain <- DDD
