# 1. Organize your ideas beforehand

Categorize knowledge that are important for that discussion, so it is easier to retrieve information about
a specific topic and associated facts

Tools:
- Mindmap

# 2. Master BLUF (Bottom line up front)

State the core message first, and follow up with necessary context. That way you reduce friction.

# 3. Storytelling

Give structure for the context detail. Storytelling is best suited for complex journey, justify a timeline or make 
an abstract concept more relatable.
```
Cycle:
    Problem -> Action -> Solution
```

Identify:
- goal
- obstacles
- actions
- results

# 4. Active listening

In a conversation make sure to paraphrase key points of the other person before you state your opinion, that way
you sound more engaged and make sure both of you are on the same page.
Fight the urge to interrupt or plant your response while they are still talking

# 5. Ask powerful questions

Before pointing the problem ask to yourself if you could ask a question that would surface your concern.
If any gap surge, ask about that specific area.

- Prepare question not just to get information but to test assumptions and guide discussion toward critical points
- Frame based on what you know letting the question communicate part of your perspective
